This website is a project built to demonstrate the practical application of concepts learned in a databases course. It utilizes PHP Native for server-side scripting, MySQL for data storage and management, and Bootstrap 5 for a modern and responsive user interface.


## Purpose

This project serves as a practical learning tool to solidify your understanding of database design, manipulation, and presentation through a real-world scenario of student attendance management. It allows you to:
- Design and implement a database schema to store student information, courses, attendance records, and potentially additional relevant data.
- Write PHP code to interact with the MySQL database, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on attendance data.
- Display and manage data through a user-friendly interface built with Bootstrap 5.
## Technologies Used

**Backend:** PHP Native (Provides a robust and flexible foundation for handling user interactions, database operations, and generating dynamic content.)

**Frontend:** Bootstrap 5 (Ensures a visually appealing and responsive website across various devices, simplifies layout creation, and offers pre-built components for common UI elements.)

**Database:** MySQL (Stores and manages website data efficiently, allowing for complex queries and data manipulation.)
